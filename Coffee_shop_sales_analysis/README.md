# Customer Loyalty Membership & Geographic Sales Analysis

## Overview
The business stakeholder wants to understand how customer loyalty (via the Loyalty Card program) correlates with purchasing behavior and sales performance across different geographic regions. Additionally, he wants insight into which product combinations (coffee type, roast type, and size) are driving profitability in key markets.
The objective is to analyze the relationship between loyalty card membership, geographic sales trends, and product profitability to identify opportunities for increasing customer retention and optimizing product offerings in high-potential regions

## Business Questions
1.	How does loyalty card membership influence sales volume, average order value, and product preferences?
2.	Which geographic regions generate the highest revenue and profit?
3.	What are the most profitable product combinations by region?
4.	Do loyalty cardholders prefer specific product attributes (e.g., premium roasts or larger sizes)?

## Recommendations 
**1. Loyalty Cardholders**

Offer discounts or promotions on premium products (e.g., Excelsa, Liberica) and larger sizes to increase AOV. Highlight Dark roast options in marketing campaigns.

**2. Non-Cardholders**

Launch targeted campaigns to encourage loyalty program sign-ups, emphasizing benefits like discounts on larger sizes and premium roasts. Focus on promoting Arabica and Liberica coffee types.

**3. Geographic Strategies**

Invest in marketing and product offerings in the United States, given its dominant revenue contribution. Explore opportunities to grow revenue in the United Kingdom, potentially by introducing new product combinations or promotions.

**4.Product Optimization**

Focus on promoting larger sizes (2.5kg) and premium roasts across all regions. Consider introducing new product bundles or discounts to drive sales of less popular combinations (e.g., Robusta).
