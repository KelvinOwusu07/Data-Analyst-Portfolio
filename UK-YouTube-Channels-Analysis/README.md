## Recommendations 
**1. Prioritize Channels with High Engagement Rates**

Leverage creators with proven audience interaction to drive conversions. High engagement rates correlate with better ad recall and conversion potential. For example, a channel with 300,000+ views per video likely has an audience primed to act on recommendations.

**2. Optimize Campaign Costs with Cost-Per-Engagement (CPE)**

Minimize wasted spend by targeting cost-efficient creators. Channels like GRM Daily or DisneyJuniorUK offer lower CPE due to their high views-to-subscriber ratios, maximizing reach per dollar spent.

**3. Estimate Product Conversion Rates**

Link engagement metrics to actual sales/conversions. Channels like KSI (gaming) may have lower conversion rates but higher reach, while Mark Ronson (music) could drive fewer but higher-quality leads.

**4. Calculate Potential ROI**

Ensure campaigns generate profitable returns. Channels with lower engagement rates (e.g., 24 News HD) may require higher budgets to achieve the same ROI as high-engagement creators.
